# character-analysis
A short script for analyzing statistics in a tabletop RPG, intended to aid in identifying the balance of strengths and weakensses for a characer or class.

The script was used in development of the [Startraveller](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qyhqqwvmyymx) game, and content from this game is displayed with permission of the author. The script reads in a .csv file contaning statistics such as health, defense, etc. describing classes and races/species from the game. It displays these statistics in two bar graphs:

1. Showing the statistics for the classes in each facet. Using this visualization, it is possible to easily see the classes that have moderate strengths in several areas (eg Con Artist) vs classes that are more specialized (eg Liason).

2. Showing the distribution of each statistic among the classes. Using this visualization, it is possible to see the range of each statistic. Note - for this system, the number of classes does make the classes somewhat difficult to distinguish by colour in this visualization. The visualization served its purpose in developing StarTraveller, but readability improvements could be made.
